# Grocery-webstore
Check out Fast Groceries, my project for my IICT course. It's an online grocery store frontend I designed using HTML and CSS. The interface is clean and easy to navigate, with categories like fruits, meats, and specials. Adding items to your cart is simple, and checkout is a breeze. FreshMart makes online grocery shopping convenient and straightforward.
